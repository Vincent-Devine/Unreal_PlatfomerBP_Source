## **Project description :**
This project was made to discover the environment of Unreal Engine 4 and its Blueprint system. We were tasked of doing a basic platformer. <br />

## **BUG : One of our Asset pack created problems for the build. We had to remove it from our projet has well as all its instances in our level. The see the cleaner version of our project, open the git GOLD version in Unreal.##**
<br />

## **To build and run the project :** 
Use the build (launch the .exe) or open the project in Unreal Engine 4.
